          Hi thereüëãüèº, my name is Prajjwal Mathur, I mainly build in Python(flask, Django), JavaScript, C++, Java and MySQL
        </p>
        <p>
          My current goals are to use my relevant skills and experience to build apps and solutions that could help my employer(currently no employer :)) and me grow exponentially.
            </p>
          <p>
            I am actively looking for suitable SDE roles, ready to go for assessments and talk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Apart from academics, I am active on Leetcode, Codeforces, and usually seen talking about motorsports and games.
